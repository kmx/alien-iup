MEDIUM PRIORITY
- more complex compile test (use some advanced iup C example, try to compile some DLL, test more then just iup lib)
- more iupweb/webkit testing (Win32 as well as GTK2)
- Win: generate makefiles for iupweb
- try to build cdcairo - when has{pangocairo}

LOW PRIORITY
- complete redesign of iup+cd+im detection - compatible with havelib() - msvc support, fix temporary *.obj files in dist root
- Unix - move essential lib detection into "perl Build.PL" phase (exit without creating Build script if essential libs not found)
- Makefile*.nmake - dynamic lib build not supported
